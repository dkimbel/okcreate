# okcreate

*Sleek, minimal, and flexible front-end framework for developers*

okcreate was put together over many years of frontend development and
represents what we consider to be the ideal base for building websites.

* Minimal - Including a couple thousand lines of CSS and then overriding them all is A Bad Idea.
* Flexible - okcreate! is designed to be adapted to your particular situation and goes through great lengths to ensure that it can modified as needed.
* Readble - The code is meant to be tinkered with, so being able to be read and understood by humans is a high priority.
* Markup Independence - Unless otherwise noted, plugins do not depend on specific markup - this gives you the flexibility to adapt okcreate to your situation, and not the other way around.
* Modular - There are plenty of bandwidth limited devices out there - let's not be wasteful.



# Usage

Full site/docs coming soon. See each /demo for grid usage and each JavaScript
plugin has it's own readme respectively.



## JavaScripts

The design methodology here is to split functionality into modules that can be
included as needed. Most scripts are split into a 'core' and then supplemented
by further enhancements. Note that most scripts won't actually do anything without
the supplemental scripts - however it makes it abundantly clear how and where you
(when you inevitably need to) make alterations to adapt the script to your particular
circumstances. 

Additionally, you get the space-saving benefit of eliminating parts of the
scripts which are unnecessary for your particular application.  Too many
scripts out there handle every edge-case inside the script leading to bloat and
maintenance difficultly.



## Stylesheets

okcreate! is different than other CSS frameworks - you don't just <em>include it</em> you <em>edit it</em>. 
It's counterproductive, and inefficient to include a 5,000 line stylesheet and
then override every single style. To this end the basic framework only sets up
sane defaults which adhere to a philosophy typographical rhythm.
