# okcreate

*Sleek, minimal, and flexible front-end framework for developers*

okcreate was put together over many years of frontend development and
represents what we consider to be the ideal base for building websites.

* Minimal - Including a couple thousand lines of CSS and then overriding them all is A Bad Idea
* Flexible - okcreate is designed to be adapted to your particular situation and goes through great lengths to ensure that it can modified as needed



# Usage

Full site/docs coming soon. See each /demo for grid usage and each javascript plugin has it's own readme respectively.
