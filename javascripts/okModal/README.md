# okModal

*Smart, easy and responsive modal windows*

Successor to okPopup, this does not attempt to support tooltips - just modal windows

## Usage

See example.html

## Dependencies

* jQuery 1.8.0 or greater - may work on earlier versions
* imagesloaded.js - Required for best results when loading images. Can operate without it, but it will be less reliable
* jquery.transit.js - Required for fancy transitions

## Notes

Supports IE8+ and proper browsers.
